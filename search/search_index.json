Pre-order Now! This kit is the culmination of Rat Rig's accumulated years of experience designing, producing and distributing DIY 3D Printer kits worldwide. Originally introduced in 2017, the V-Core went through several iterations and multiple variants over time, through a process of continuously seeking user feedback to drive product development. The lessons learned over the years allowed us to understand what works and what doesn't, what features are most valued by users, and what choices ensure both quality and affordability. We've distilled all this knowledge into the V-Core 3, which was designed in partnership with Pawel Kucmus, a long time member of our on-line community and one of the most prolific contributors to the V-Core platform. Pre-order Now! Precision \u00b6 3 Point Kinematic Bed 6mm Cast Tooling Plate for Print bed Immaculate CoreXY Belt Path All movement guided by MGN12 Linear Rails Doubled Z resolution with TR8x4 Lead Screws instead of TR8x8 Robustness \u00b6 While previous V-Core versions, like many other printers on the market, relied solely on 20 Series profiles, the V-Core 3 is fully built on a 30 Series aluminium frame. From screws and nuts to brackets and plates, everything is bigger, stronger and tougher. Frame made with 30x30mm T-Slot aluminium with a beautiful black anodization 4mm thick anodized aluminium plates 9mm Belts Weight of Z drivetrain and bed is distributed across the Z motor mounts - not on the motors themselves Customization \u00b6 Available both as a complete kit and a configurable kit (for those who want to select their own electronics) Configurable options include LDO motors, Keenovo Heatpads, and multiple controller board options (from Duet3D, SKR, etc) 3 build volumes available as standard option: 300, 400 and 500 mm3 V-Core 3 variant Build Volume (mm) External dimensions (mm)* 300 300x300x300 518x583x560 400 400x400x400 618x683x660 500 500x500x500 718x783x760 *Z height corresponds to frame height. Your extruder head will protrude slightly above the frame, and you will need extra Z room for filament feed. For the frame version with a top chamber, add 245mm to the given Z height. Full End Stop solutions EVA 2 Carriage System provides mounts for most popular extruder and hot end choices on the market (Bowden, BMG, Titan, Aero, Hemera, and more to come!) Shipping with EVA 2.2.1 What is EVA? EVA is an independently developed and maintained project that aims to be a single platform for many extrusion types. Copperhead and Bondtech LGX support incoming! Note that not all print head types (due to their physical dimensions) can achieve the full 300x300 print space. EVA 2 is the next iteration of the EVA platform with which V-Core 3 is fully compatible. Most vivid improvements since the last iteration is the improved front belt clamp feature (no more zip ties!), improved contribution system, more ease of assembly, modular X endstop system, dedicated cable paths and shrouds (for ascetics). Read more about EVA on: EVA 2 Documentation Support \u00b6 Fully comprehensive step by step build guide (Both static and video) Fully comprehensive wiring and electronics guide for multiple controller boards Support configuration files for several firmware choices (Reprap, Marlin, Klipper) Join our Facebook 3D Printer Community to connect with other V-Core users, share builds, knowledge, mods, and stay posted on all V-Core 3 developments. Safety \u00b6 Wiring design includes multiple cable management parts, for cable clamping, guiding and strain relief Custom Keenovo Heat Pad with pre-wired 157\u00baC Thermal Fuse for extra safety (Optional) For 220V Heat pad users, grounding point at the bed and fully isolated bed from the rest of the printer means that the printer frame is never conducting any dangerous voltages. Convenience \u00b6 Designed for a far easier and quicker assembly than previous versions Separate chamber for electronics ensures heat insulation, short motor cable path, easy access to all wiring, and a very clean installation. Easily and fully enclosable frame Optional top lid IEC and LAN ports Modding \u00b6 The V-Core 3 is the perfect printer for advanced users who like to tweak and tinker with their machine: Fully open-source design, with downloadable 3D models and part libraries freely available Frame is built on a modular platform of T-Slot and V-Slot profiles, which allow for endless possibilites when it comes to mounting all types of parts Vast catalog of stand-alone parts available for infinite upgradeability: screws, nuts, connectors, brackets, pulleys, belts, electronics, etc Sample Prints \u00b6 Availability \u00b6 The V-Core 3 will start shipping in Q1 2021. Until then: Stay posted on all the developments at our Facebook 3D Printer Community Get notified via e-mail once the kit is officially released (simply send an e-mail to info@ratrig.com with \"V-Core 3 Waiting List\" on the subject line) E-mail us!

This page will be updated with additional information as we approach the launch date. Acknowledgments \u00b6 As an Open-source project, the V-Core 3 design is the result of prolonged brainstorming, testing, and collaboration between many active members of the international 3D Printer Community, who shared their knowledge and experience with our design team. As such, the machine inevitably draws inspiration from and builds upon many existing design elements that have been developed, shared, tested, modded, and iterated by the community at large. The nature of the open-source movement makes it often difficult to trace back where each idea was originally generated, making it hard to produce a comprehensive list of acknowledgments. Nevertheless, below we list a few names and projects that we would like to credit for their direct or indirect contribution/inspiration to the V-Core 3 platform (in no particular order): Hypercube by Tech2c Voron BLV Jubilee Simon Davie Jo\u00e3o Barros Detlev Rackow M\u00e1rcio Pereira Eduardo Oliveira Mikkel Schmidt Harald Wagener Antonios Antzoulatos Lukas Sinitsch Tomasz Paluszkiewicz Licence \u00b6 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#v-core-3","text":"The V-Core 3 is a premium DIY kit for a CoreXY 3D Printer with no compromises.

Developed on top of the v1.2 build, this version completely redesigns the Z axis of the machine to incorporate the 3 point kinematic bed feature which we introduced in the V-Core 3 . v1.3 is available as an upgrade kit from v1.1 and v1.2, which you can buy here . User Testimonials \u00b6 The new v1.3 comes with the most precise Z drive mechanism I ever found in a 3D printer. After one trim operation, the bed squareness is below 0.02mm on a 300x300 bed. It doesn't get better than that! Simple and clear: it is a huge improvement for the Z axis. The old concept with two rails on the sides never glided as smoothly as the new one - there was always a bit of friction in the rails which caused noise. I didn\u2018t know any better and thought it was standard for a machine with 3 z motors, and I was a bit skeptic about the new design. Now, after one month of operation, I know better. The new Z drive is smoother. It runs so silent I can be in the printer-room and don\u2018t notice the moving bed. Detlev Rackow Much easier to assemble and get right. Much better bed support, especially on large beds. I went from a 1.4mm height variance to just 0.3mm on the 1.3 on my 500mm bed! That's just INSANE! I would highly recommend this upgrade to everyone!

Note that not all print head types (due to their physical dimensions) can achieve the full 300x300 print space. EVA 2 is the next iteration of the EVA platform with which V-Core Pro is fully compatible. Most vivid improvements since the last iteration is the improved front belt clamp feature (no more zip ties!), improved contribution system, more ease of assembly, modular X endstop system, dedicated cable paths and shrouds (for ascetics).
